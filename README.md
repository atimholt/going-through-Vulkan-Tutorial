Vulkan Tutorial website code
============================

Tweaked by Tim Holt. Found at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code

Iâ€™m changing whatever I want as I go along, and using this opportunity to learn a lot about my chosen build tool as well (waf).

Also contains code for unit testing.
